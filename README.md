# Abstract
Phenotypic divergence is an important consequence of restricted gene flow in insular
populations. This divergence can be challenging to detect when it occurs through subtle shifts in
morphological traits, particularly in traits with complex geometries, like insect wing venation.
Here, we employed geometric morphometrics to assess the extent of variation in wing venation
patterns across reproductively isolated populations of the social sweat bee, _Halictus tripartitus_.
We examined wing morphology of specimens sampled from a reproductively isolated population
of _H. tripartitus_ on Santa Cruz Island (Channel Islands, Southern California). Our analysis
revealed significant differentiation in wing venation in this island population relative to
conspecific mainland populations. We additionally found that this population-level variation was
less pronounced than the species-level variation in wing venation among three sympatric
congeners native to the region, _Halictus tripartitus_, _Halictus ligatus_, and _Halictus farinosus_.
Together, these results provide evidence for subtle phenotypic divergence in an island bee
population. More broadly, these results emphasize the utility and potential of wing
morphometrics for large-scale assessment of insect population structure.
